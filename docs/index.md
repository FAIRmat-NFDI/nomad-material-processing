# Welcome to the NOMAD-materials-processing Plugin Documentation

Welcome to the official documentation for the **NOMAD-materials-processing Plugin**! This plugin provides NOMAD schemas, readers, and parsers for data of materials science synthesis processes in alignment with the FAIR (Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable) principles. It serves as a community or standard plugin, offering commonly used schemas and classes/sections for materials processing data that can be shared across a community.

## Supported Measurement Techniques

Currently, this plugin supports the following materials processing techniques:

- **Vapor deposition**:

  Supports Physical Vapor Deposition (PVD) and Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD) based processes such as:
  Molecular Beam Epitaxy (MBE), Pulsed Laser Deposition (PLD), Sputtering, Thermal Evaporation, and Metalorganic Vapor Phase Epitaxy (MOVPE)

- **wet chemistry**:

  Supports Solution Preparation

Additional materials processing techniques are actively being developed and will be included soon, including:
Bulk Crystal growth (Synthesis from the melt), Polymerization, ...(what is coming???)

Stay tuned for updates as more methods become available!

## What You Will Find in This Documentation

This documentation builds upon the general [NOMAD documentation](https://nomad-lab.eu/prod/v1/staging/docs/explanation/data.html). Here, you will find comprehensive guides on:

- **Using the Plugin**: Step-by-step instructions on how to integrate and use the NOMAD Materials Processing Plugin in your NOMAD Oasis.
- **Data Structures and Supported Methods**: Detailed descriptions of the available schemas, sections, and supported materials processing techniques.
- **Contributing**: Learn how you can contribute to the ongoing development of this plugin.

## About NOMAD

NOMAD is an open-source data management platform tailored for materials science, designed to follow the FAIR principles. It offers a robust framework for managing and sharing materials data in a standardized and interoperable manner. To learn more about NOMAD, visit the [official homepage](https://nomad-lab.eu).


We hope this documentation provides all the information you need to make the most of the NOMAD Measurements Plugin. Feel free to [contact](contact.md) us for further questions.
